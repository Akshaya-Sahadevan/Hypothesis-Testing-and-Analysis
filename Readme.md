# Hypothesis Testing and Data Analysis of Bike ride dataset

‍♀️ Testing the Ride: A Statistical Look at Bike Sharing
This project dives into the world of bike sharing with a focus on hypothesis testing . We'll be analyzing a bike sharing dataset to uncover hidden patterns and test our assumptions  .  Using statistical methods, we'll explore factors influencing ridership and see if they hold water statistically  .  Get ready for some exciting discoveries as we explore the fascinating world of bike sharing data!
The project uses programming languages like Python, Pyspark, SQL and statistical hypothesis testing methods.

It cover the below session:
1. Data Loading and initial exploration
2. Data Preparation
3. Data Visualisation to understand behavious of the features
4. Hypothesis Testing using Statistical Methods (eg: T-test)
5. Manual Validation of the Hypothesis test result

In this project I am doing Hypothesis Testing on two dataset. The first one is based on one dataset which is the Chicago dataset and the second one is a combination of Chicago bike ride dataset and the London bike ride dataset.
